  <p class="white-text padding">
    The following form is for Guest List admittance for Saturday Night Dance
    parties. The guest list opens at 3:00 AM on Sunday morning and is open to
    the first 100  people that sign up or by Saturdays at noon. Getting to the
    club by 11:00PM is mandatory for VIP access ( skip the line ).
    Additionally, all guests in your party must have a State issued ID,
    passport, or valid military license. This guest list doesn't give free
    admission, it just allows you to skip the line.
